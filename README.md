# match3-Unity

These are C# scripts for a match-3 game (like bejeweled) on the Unity game engine. It runs on Android devices. 

Unity handles the background timing and drawing of assets. The logic, positioning, and some of the animation is handled in these scripts.

All code was written by me. The vast majority of the code is in GameManager.
